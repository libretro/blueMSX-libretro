This is the blueMSX 1.6.0 source code. It builds with Visual Studio 2003 and gcc. 

Unfortunately we don't have the VC6 environment anymore and if someone updates the VC6 project file I'd be happy to update the source zip so other VC6 developers can benifit from the update.

Thanks, 
blueMSX dev team.
